# Bevy 2048 Game Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of actionable tasks to improve the codebase of the Bevy 2048 game. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Documentation

- [ ] Create a comprehensive README.md with game description, installation instructions, and controls
- [ ] Add documentation comments to all public functions, structs, and enums
- [ ] Create architecture documentation explaining the game's structure and data flow
- [ ] Document the shader implementation and visual effects system
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex algorithms (especially in the game logic)

## Code Quality

- [ ] Fix TODOs in the codebase (especially in src/game/mod.rs)
- [ ] Fix the error in queued_merge_system (line 507-509) where effect_query.get() is incomplete
- [ ] Implement proper error handling instead of using expect() calls
- [ ] Add more comprehensive logging throughout the application
- [ ] Refactor the board manipulation logic to be more readable and maintainable
- [ ] Extract magic numbers into named constants (e.g., board size, animation durations)
- [ ] Implement unit tests for core game logic
- [ ] Add integration tests for game state transitions

## Architecture Improvements

- [ ] Split the large game/mod.rs file into smaller, more focused modules
- [ ] Create a dedicated module for board manipulation functions
- [ ] Implement a proper game over and win screen instead of just state changes
- [ ] Refactor the QueuedCommand enum to use a more idiomatic approach
- [ ] Improve the event handling system to be more robust
- [ ] Consider using a more structured approach for game state management
- [ ] Extract UI components into reusable widgets

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Profile the game to identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize shader code by removing redundant calculations
- [ ] Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed entities
- [ ] Optimize the board rotation algorithm
- [ ] Review and optimize entity queries to minimize system overhead
- [ ] Consider using sparse sets for component storage where appropriate

## Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Implement game score tracking and display
- [ ] Add animations for tile creation and merging
- [ ] Implement a high score system with persistence
- [ ] Add sound effects for tile movements and merges
- [ ] Implement touch/mouse controls for mobile and desktop
- [ ] Add game difficulty levels (different board sizes)
- [ ] Implement undo functionality
- [ ] Add a game timer and time-based challenges

## WASM Support

- [ ] Complete the WASM compatibility work (uncomment and fix the WASM-specific code)
- [ ] Test and optimize the game for web browsers
- [ ] Implement proper touch controls for mobile web browsers
- [ ] Add PWA support for offline play in browsers

## Visual Improvements

- [ ] Create a consistent visual theme throughout the game
- [ ] Improve the bloom effect parameters for better visual appeal
- [ ] Add more visual feedback for user actions
- [ ] Implement responsive UI that works well on different screen sizes
- [ ] Add animations for menu transitions
- [ ] Improve the game board appearance with better tile designs

## Build and Deployment

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and building
- [ ] Create release configurations for different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Web)
- [ ] Implement automated versioning
- [ ] Add a proper license file to the repository
- [ ] Create distribution packages for different platforms
